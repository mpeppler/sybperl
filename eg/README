Sybperl 2 examples

This directory contains a couple of example scripts, which I hope will
prove to be a valid complement to the documentation:

  - bcp.pl    Example on the use of the DBlibrary BCP API. It's a very
              primitive example.
  - buffer.pl Perl 5 class inheritance example. This example
              implements DBlibrary's buffer routines (dbgetrow(),
              DBFIRSTROW(), DBLASTROW()) in Perl by creating a new
              package called Sybase::DBlib::Buffer, which inherits the
              capabilities of Sybase::DBlib, and overrides certain
              routines (such as dbnextrow() and dbresults()) to add
              functionality.
  - ct_sql.pl An example of usage of the ct_sql() call (CTlibrary)
  - ctlib.pl  A simple CTlibrary example.            
  - ct_cursor.pl How to use the ct_cursor() call (CTlibrary)
  - ct_param.pl  How to use the ct_param() call (CTlibrary)
  - dbcc.pl   Run dbcc checkdb, checkalloc, checktable on a database and
              get only the errors in the mail...(uses CTlibrary)
  - rpc-example.pl How to use the dbprc*() calls (DBlibrary)
  - who.pl    An extended sp_who, in Perl.

  - GenRepDefs.pl
              Contributed by Ashu Joglekar, this script can be used to
              generate RepDefs and Subscriptions for a database
              (Replication Server type info).

  - dbschema.pl, dbschema.old, dbschema.10.pl
              Three versions of the dbschema.pl script that was
              originally included with sybperl 1.0xx. See the file
              README.dbschema for details.

  - Show.cgi
              Display the text of triggers, stored procs, etc in
              html format with keywords highlighted.

  - Login.pm  Submitted by Brent B. Powers.
              Login.pm is a tkPerl widget for loging in to Sybase.
              It must be placed in $PERL5LIB/Sybase/Login.pm to be
              used.

              operations. It includes its own documentation.

This is the sybperl 1.0xx compatibility package for Perl 5.

This package has been built so that sybperl 1.0xx scripts will
continue to run with Perl 5 with (hopefully) no modification.

Saying

	require 'sybperl.pl';
or
	use Sybperl.pm;

is enough to use the Perl 5 version.

All the sybperl code that I have works with this release, provided I
change calls taking no parameters from '&foo;' to '&foo();' to avoid
inheriting a previously defined @_ in sub foo.

I suggest that for future developments you use the Sybase::DBlib
module directly: this will remove one layer of code (and of possible
bugs...) from the execution, and future developments may not be back
ported to Sybase::Sybperl.

README for Sybase::BLK.

This module is intended to be used on top of the Sybase::CTlib module
of sybperl 2.13_08 or later. It is a direct port of Sybase::BCP, and
was performed by Scott Zetlan.

INSTALLATION:

If you are installing sybperl 2.13 or later, then this module will get
automatically installed.

If you are installing a new version of Sybase::BLK on top of an
existing Sybase::CTlib module, then simply type

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

in this directory.

The date conversion routines have not been well tested.

As always, comments are welcome, either to myself <mpeppler@peppler.org> or
to the sybperl mailing list <sybperl-l@listproc.net>>

Michael
